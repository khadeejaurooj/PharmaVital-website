        <h1 id="medicine-price">Project Title: Implementing a New Dissolution Testing Method for a Sustained-Release Painkiller Tablet</h1>
        <p id="medicine-description"><b>Scientist:</b> Dr. Sarah Gill, Quality Control Analyst: at  PharmaVital<br>
            <b>Project Goal:</b> To validate and implement a new dissolution testing method for a sustained-release painkiller tablet 
            to ensure consistent drug release over time.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Project Phases:</b><br>
            <b>Phase 1: Method Development and Validation</b><br>
            * Ms. Sarah Gill would research and review current dissolution testing methods for sustained-release tablets.<br>
            * She would collaborate with analytical chemists to develop a new method that accurately measures the drug's release
            profile at specific time intervals, mimicking its behavior in the body.<br>
            * Validation experiments would be conducted to demonstrate the new method's accuracy, precision, and robustness (reproducibility
            under slight variations).<br>
            <br>
            <b>Phase 2: Implementation and Ongoing Monitoring</b>
            * Once validated, Ms. Sarah Gill would create detailed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the new dissolution testing 
            method ensuring its consistent application by all analysts.<br>
            * She would train other QC personnel on the new method and ensure all equipment is properly calibrated and functioning correctly.<br>
            * Ms. Gill would then integrate the new method into the routine testing process for every batch of the painkiller tablets produced.<br>
            * She would analyze the dissolution data and flag any batches that fall outside the established parameters, potentially
            triggering investigations or product rejection.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Project Timeline:</b><br>
            This project would likely take several months to complete. While seemingly smaller in scale than
            research projects, it's crucial for ensuring patient safety and product efficacy.<br>
            <b>Ms. Gill's Role:</b>Ms. Gill would utilize her knowledge of pharmaceutical analysis, quality control procedures,
             and regulatory requirements.  Her key responsibilities would be:<br>
             * Researching and developing the method<br>
             * Performing validation experiments<br>
             * Creating SOPs and training personnel<br>
             * Implementing the method in routine testing<br>
             * Analyzing data and reporting any deviations<br>
