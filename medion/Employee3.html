        <h1 id="medicine-price">Project Title: Development of a Personalized Immunotherapy for Cancer</h1>
        <p id="medicine-description"><b>Scientist:</b> Dr. Farah Khan, Research Scientist at  PharmaVital<br>
            <b>Project Goal:</b> To develop a new approach to cancer treatment using immunotherapy, 
            where a patient's own immune system is harnessed to fight their specific tumor.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Project Phases:</b><br>
            <b>Phase 1:  Biomarker Discovery and Patient Selection</b><br>
            * Dr. Khan would collaborate with immunologists and geneticists to identify unique genetic 
            markers on a patient's tumor cells<br>
            * These markers would act as targets for the immune system to recognize and destroy the cancer cells.<br>
            * The project would involve developing a diagnostic test to identify patients whose tumors are suitable 
            for this type of personalized therapy.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Phase 2:  Engineering Immune Cells and Pre-clinical Testing</b><br>
            * Once tumor markers are identified, Dr. Khan would design a method to extract a patient's immune cells (T-cells)
            and engineer them to recognize and attack the specific markers on their cancer cells.<br>
            * This might involve gene editing techniques to enhance the T-cells' ability to target the tumor.
            * Pre-clinical studies would be conducted using cell cultures and animal models to assess the safety and efficacy of<br>
            the engineered T-cells.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Phase 3:  Clinical Trials and Treatment Optimization</b><br>
            * If pre-clinical studies are successful, Dr. Chen would work with clinical trial specialists to design protocols for
            testing the personalized immunotherapy in a small group of patients.<br>
            * The project would involve monitoring patients' responses and refining the T-cell engineering process for better treatment
            outcomes.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Project Timeline:</b> Similar to the Alzheimer's project, this could be a multi-year endeavor with uncertain success at each
            stage. Personalized medicine is a growing field with the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment.<br>
            <b>Dr. Khan's Role:</b>  Dr. Khan would  leverage her expertise in immunology, cell biology, and potentially gene editing techniques.
            She would be responsible for designing experiments, analyzing patient data, collaborating with a cross-functional team, and<br>
            ensuring the project adheres to ethical and regulatory guidelines.<br>
