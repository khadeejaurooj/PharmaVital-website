        <h1 id="medicine-price">Project: Developing a Novel Antidepressant Medication</h1>
        <p id="medicine-description"><b>Scientist:</b> Dr. Ahmed Ali, Research Scientist at  PharmaVital<br>
            <b>Project Goal:</b> Develop a new, more effective antidepressant medication with fewer
            side effects than current options.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Project Activities:</b><br>
            <b>Target Identification:</b> Dr. Ahmad began by researching the neurochemical pathways involved
            in depression. He identified a specific receptor in the brain that plays a role in regulating mood.<br> 
            This receptor became the target for the new medication.<br>
            <b>Compound Screening:</b> Using a combination of computational modeling and high-throughput
            screening techniques, Dr. Ahmed and his team evaluated a vast library of potential drug candidates.<br> 
            This stage involved testing thousands of compounds to see if they interacted with the target receptor
            in a desired way.<br>
            <b>Preclinical Testing:</b> The most promising candidate drugs were then tested in animal models of
            depression. These studies assessed their effectiveness in improving depressive symptoms and<br>
            compared them to existing medications.<br>
            <b>Safety and Efficacy Studies (if successful):</b> If the preclinical studies were positive,
            Dr. Ahmed would work with a team to design and conduct clinical trials in human patients.<br>
            These trials would involve rigorous testing to determine the medication's safety, efficacy,
            and optimal dosage in humans.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Project Outcomes (Possible Scenarios):</b><br>
            <b>Success:</b> Dr. Ahmed's research could lead to the development of a new, more effective
            antidepressant medication with fewer side effects. This would be a significant breakthrough<br>
            in the treatment of depression, offering relief to millions of people worldwide. PharmCo
            could then pursue regulatory approval and commercialization of the drug.<br>
            <b>Challenges:</b> Unfortunately, drug development is a high-risk process with a high rate of
            failure. There is a possibility that the promising candidate drugs don't perform well in<br>
            preclinical or clinical trials, leading to the project being halted.<br>
